# H3ro Compiler

![CI](https://github.com/h3rogam3r8/h3roCompiler/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Hero is a small tensor language and the compiler that turns it into fast code.
It's built on MLIR and LLVM, and it targets three things: a CPU, an NVIDIA GPU,
and a made-up accelerator called Anvil (get it?) that I also have to write a simulator for.

**Where it's at:** the front end works. Hero source gets lexed, parsed, and
printed as a tree, with error messages that point at the right token. No type
checking yet, and MLIR hasn't shown up at all. Roadmap below.

## Why

I want to understand how ML compilers actually work. MLIR dialects, LLVM
codegen, GPU kernels, and other important concepts like dataflow analysis and
register allocation.

The Anvil backend is the part I'm most interested in. CPUs and GPUs schedule
instructions for you. A systolic accelerator doesn't, so the compiler has to do
instruction selection, register allocation, and scheduling itself.

## What the language looks like

```hero
fn mlp(x:  tensor<[B, 768],    f16>,
       w1: tensor<[768, 3072], f16>, b1: tensor<[3072], f16>,
       w2: tensor<[3072, 768], f16>, b2: tensor<[768], f16>)
    -> tensor<[B, 768], f16>
{
    let h = matmul(x, w1) + b1;
    let a = gelu(h);
    matmul(a, w2) + b2
}
```

Shapes are part of the type, so mismatches are compile errors. `B` is symbolic,
which means one compiled function handles any batch size. Full spec is in
`docs/spec/hero.md`.

## Building

Needs CMake 3.20+, Ninja, and a C++17 compiler. googletest gets downloaded
during configure, so the first build needs internet.

```
brew install cmake ninja          # or apt install cmake ninja-build

cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
./build/tests/hero_tests
```

Then try it on something:

```
./build/tools/heroc/heroc examples/mlp.hero --emit=ast
./build/tools/heroc/heroc examples/mlp.hero --emit=tokens
```

## How it fits together

```
.hero file
    |
    v
lexer -> parser -> type and shape checking
    |
    v
`hero` dialect        graph level: fusion, layout, constant folding
    |
    v
linalg / affine       loop level: tiling, vectorization, memory planning
    |
    +--------------+--------------+
    v              v              v
  LLVM          NVVM/PTX        Anvil
  CPU           RTX 2060        simulator
```

ONNX and PyTorch models get imported at the `hero` dialect level later on, so
they share every optimization below that point.

## Roadmap

Each phase should end with something I can actually run.

## Not doing

No general-purpose language features. Single device only.

## Machines

I develop on an M2 Pro Mac (ARM NEON, no CUDA) and do GPU work on an RTX 2060
laptop through WSL2. The 2060 is Turing. From what I can tell that means
`mma.sync` tensor cores work on it but `cp.async` doesn't, since that one
needs sm_80. I expect to find out the hard way. The plan is to test GPU code
by checking the generated PTX as text, which shouldn't need a GPU at all.
